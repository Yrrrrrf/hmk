## 🚀 Overview

This is a new full-stack application, `db`, generated by the [db (GWA)](https://github.com/Yrrrrrf/db) scaffolding tool.

It provides a robust foundation with a backend API, a database, and a frontend client, all containerized and ready to run.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

-   **Backend**: Python with FastAPI, leveraging `prism-py` for automatic API generation.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL, fully containerized with Docker.
-   **Frontend**: SvelteKit with Deno, styled with TailwindCSS.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Ready to be packaged as a desktop application using Tauri.

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose
-   [Deno](https://deno.land/) (for frontend development)
-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (for Tauri desktop builds)

### Running the Application

1.  **Review the Environment File**: A `.env` file has been created in the project root with your database credentials. You can modify it if needed.

2.  **Start the services using Docker Compose**:
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Access the Services**:
    -   **API Docs**: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
    -   **Frontend App**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
